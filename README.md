# F4W Forwarder - Python Edition

It's a Python version of the original [F4WForwarder](https://github.com/marcus-crane/f4wforwarder) that I built in Javascript.

# What is it for?

WOR, short for Wrestling Observer Radio, is a near-daily podcast/radio show from [Dave Meltzer](https://twitter.com/davemeltzerWON) and [Bryan Alvarez](https://twitter.com/bryanalvarez).

The actual show itself requires a paid account to access the audio files. The content is worth it, however unfortunately, a lot of podcast clients don't support private podcasts.

Personally, I like to use Pocket Casts and they only support public podcasts so this is a small Flask app that generates a "public" feed that's usable with it.

# Public?! Whoa, you're like pirating and stuff??

Haha, not quite!

The rest is to be written bleh bleh
